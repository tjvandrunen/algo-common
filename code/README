The codebase for Algorithmic Commonplaces contains examples from the 
book and starter code for the exercises and projects. The code is in 
Java, Python, C, and SML. The top level organization is by language. 
Since the java portion of the code base is the largest (and since all
of the projects are in Java), the java directory is organized into directories
for examples, exercises, and projects.

See the README files in varous subdirectories for more information on how
the code in that directory is organized.
