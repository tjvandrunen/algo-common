The C portion of the code base is organized into directories each 
containing a collection of C implementation and header files, with a 
makefile.

All of the adt-* folders are from Section 2.6 ADTs and data structures 
in other languages, showing different versions of the code.

adt-simple -- Examples from Section 2.6 original version, introducing 
headers, structs, etc.

adt-funcptr -- Examples from Section 2.6 "Version 2," building structs 
similar to Java classes using function pointers.

adt-kernel -- Examples from Section 2.6 "Version 3," after the style of 
the Linux kernel.

bitops -- Examples from Section 3.4 N-sets and bit vectors

btree -- Example from Section 5.6

sort-experiments -- Examples from Section 1.4 Experiments and 3.1 
Linear-time sorting algorithms
