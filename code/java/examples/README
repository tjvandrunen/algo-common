The Java code here is used for examples in the text. Most directories 
are organized into packages with the following naming scheme:

adt: interfaces defining abstract data types
impl: classes representing data structures that implement the adts
alg: classes with static methods implementing algorithms
test: JUnit tests
exper: experiments

For some sections in the book, the example code in the text is drawn 
from the project code. In those cases, find the code in ../projects.

adt-basic -- Examples from Sections 2.(1-5) & 2.7; similar code appears under 
../problems/adt-practice, but with some parts of the code removed

bst-basic -- Examples from Section 5.2 Binary search trees

assert-findmissing -- Examples from 2.7 Programming practices

disj-set -- Examples from Section 3.2 Disjoint sets and array forests; 
also contains starter code for Exercises 3.(4, 5, 8, 10, 12)

rdparse -- Example code from Section 8.5; also contains starter code for 
Exercises 8.(53 & 57)

triemap -- Example from Section 8.2
