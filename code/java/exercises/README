This directory contains starter code for the exercises that are 
programminng problems in Java. These are distinct from the projects, as 
exercises tend to be shorter and more applied. Most directories have a 
single package of the same name as the enclosing folder.

For starter code for Exercises 3.(4, 5, 8, 10, 12), see ../examples/disj-set.

For starter code for Exercise 3.19, see ../projects/pq-heap
