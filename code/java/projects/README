(except pretest) is organized into packages with the following naming 
scheme (not all projects have all such packages):

adt: interfaces defining abstract data types
impl: classes representing data structures that implement the adts
alg: classes with static methods implementing algorithms
test: JUnit tests
exper: experiments
