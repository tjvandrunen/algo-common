<p><i>Algorithmic Commonplaces</i> is a textbook for
a second-year course in data structures and algorithms.

<p><a href="https://github.com/tjvandrunen/algo-common">Github repository for
accompanying code base</a>. 
Most of the code, including all of the projects, is in Java. Additional
examples and some exercises are in C, Python, and Standard ML (SML).
It took some last-minute clean up to get to code base ready to be
publicly available in time for the publication of the book in March 2023.
There still are a few bits and pieces missing (including starter code
for many of the exercises in Chapter 4 Graphs).
If you find anything not right with the code base---or if you want
me to hurry up and push a missing piece that you want---please get
in touch with me. 
</p>

<p>I also plan to make other supplemental material available, especially
to support instructors who adopt the book.</p>
